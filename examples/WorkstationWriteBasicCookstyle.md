## The Basics of Creating a Cookstyle Cop.

### The Basic Format
```
module RuboCop
 module Cop
   module Chef
     module ${Cop Type}
       # Cookbook:: This is the cop’s purpose.
       #
       # @example
       #
       #   # bad
       #   ${bad example code}
       #
       #   # good
       #   ${good example code}
       #
       class ${Cop Name} < Cop
         MSG = 'This will be displayed on violation'.freeze
 
         def_node_matcher :search_method?, <<-PATTERN
           ${AST Pattern Here}
         PATTERN
 
         def on_send(node)
           search_method?(node) do |check|
             add_offense(node, location: :expression, message: MSG, severity: :refactor) unless check condition
           end
         end
 
         def autocorrect(node)
           lambda do |corrector|
             new_val = 'new value'
             corrector.replace(node.loc.expression, new_val)
           end
         end
       end
     end
   end
 end
end
```

### Node Matcher and AST

Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) allows you to crawl trees of text, and the Rubocop documentation gives a good overview. It’s a good idea to read the following document from them, as it will give you a decent look at Cookstyle:

#### Ruby Parse
```
$ ruby-parse -h
Usage: ruby-parse [options] FILE|DIRECTORY...
        --18                         Parse as Ruby 1.8.7 would
        --19                         Parse as Ruby 1.9.3 would
        --20                         Parse as Ruby 2.0 would
        --21                         Parse as Ruby 2.1 would
        --22                         Parse as Ruby 2.2 would
        --23                         Parse as Ruby 2.3 would
        --24                         Parse as Ruby 2.4 would
        --25                         Parse as Ruby 2.5 would
        --26                         Parse as Ruby 2.6 would
        --27                         Parse as Ruby 2.7 would
        --28                         Parse as Ruby 2.8 would
        --mac                        Parse as MacRuby 0.12 would
        --ios                        Parse as mid-2015 RubyMotion would
    -w, --warnings                   Enable warnings
    -B, --benchmark                  Benchmark the processor
    -e fragment                      Process a fragment of Ruby code
    -L, --locate                     Explain how source maps for AST nodes are laid out
    -E, --explain                    Explain how the source is tokenized
        --emit-ruby                  Emit S-expressions as valid Ruby code
        --emit-json                  Emit S-expressions as valid JSON
    -h, --help                       Display this help message and exit
    -V, --version                    Output version information and exit
```
Here's an example of how the parser looks in action:
```
ruby-parse -e "bad example text here"
(send nil :bad
  (send nil :example
    (send nil :text
      (send nil :here))))
```
However, if we want to look at a step through of each selector in that example to understand the selection better, we will want to use -LE:
```
$ ruby-parse -LEe "bad example text here"
bad example text here   
^~~ tIDENTIFIER "bad"                           expr_cmdarg  [0 <= cond] [0 <= cmdarg] 
bad example text here   
    ^~~~~~~ tIDENTIFIER "example"               expr_arg     [0 <= cond] [0 <= cmdarg] 
bad example text here   
            ^~~~ tIDENTIFIER "text"             expr_arg     [0 <= cond] [1 <= cmdarg] 
bad example text here   
                 ^~~~ tIDENTIFIER "here"        expr_arg     [0 <= cond] [11 <= cmdarg] 
bad example text here   
                     ^ false "$eof"             expr_arg     [0 <= cond] [111 <= cmdarg] 
s(:send, nil, :bad,
  s(:send, nil, :example,
    s(:send, nil, :text,
      s(:send, nil, :here))))
bad example text here
~~~ selector                    
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ expression
s(:send, nil, :example,
  s(:send, nil, :text,
    s(:send, nil, :here)))
bad example text here
    ~~~~~~~ selector            
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ expression
s(:send, nil, :text,
  s(:send, nil, :here))
bad example text here
            ~~~~ selector       
            ~~~~~~~~~ expression
s(:send, nil, :here)
bad example text here
                 ~~~~ selector  
                 ~~~~ expression
```
## Example Rule
```
module RuboCop
  module Cop
    module Chef
      module ChefCorrectness
        # Cookbook:: metadata.rb maintainer_email field should be set to
        # cs@chef.io
        #
        # @example
        #
        #   # bad
        #   maintainer_email 'me@me.com'
        #
        #   # good
        #   maintainer_email 'cs@chef.io'
        #
        class ChefMaintainerEmail < Cop
          MSG = 'Maintainer should be set to "cs@chef.io"'.freeze
```
The section above is the general basic form taken. Code comments document what the cop should do, and shows examples of what it flags and does not.

MSG defines the message displayed with the violation. In this case, it will violate and tell the user that the 'Maintainer should be set to "cs@chef.io"' and prevent modifications to that string. 
```
          # Start checking nodes for matches.
          def_node_matcher :chef_maintainer_email?, <<-PATTERN
            (send nil? :maintainer_email
              (str $_))
          PATTERN
```
Here we define our matching pattern to check each code "node" for matching. In this case, we're looking for a line that starts with some kind of space and "maintainer_email," followed by a string. This is what will be matched when the rule is run and is expressed in AST. The trailing string is returned into a variable for later use.
```
          def on_send(node)
            chef_maintainer_email?(node) do |email|
              add_offense(node, location: :expression, message: MSG, severity: :refactor) unless email == 'cs@chef.io'
            end
          end
```
The actual matching happens here. The node matching block defined in the previous section is checked against all of the code. With the returned matching text, which gets stored in email, and checked to ensure cs@chef.io is matched, and if not, add an offense.
```
          def autocorrect(node)
            lambda do |corrector|
              new_val = 'maintainer_email \'cs@chef.io\''
              corrector.replace(node.loc.expression, new_val)
            end
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```
The last method handles the autocorrection portion of the Cookstyle rules, and replaces the node with the defined value. 
## FAQs
1. How do I return the matched text, or a portion of it, for testing specific values?<br />
$ combined with a matcher will return that match. This will allow partial matches on a value. ‘…’ will return an array, while ‘_’ will return a string.
2. The matches aren't returning as expected using the generated AST. What's wrong?<br /> 
Use `:send, nil?` instead of `:send, nil`.<br /> 
Examples: $... will return an array of matches, $_ will return a string.
